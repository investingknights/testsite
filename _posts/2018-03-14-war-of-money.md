## What role do you and I have to play in this war?
Sorry to break this to you, we all are already playing a role, a role of a spectator without us even realising it. Moreover, **you’re at the centre of all of this**.
<br/><br/>
## How?
Look around you and observe. Let me help you there.
 - You wake up probably by an alarm clock in your **phone** (Samsung, Motorola, Apple and Xiaomi etc)
 - You go to washroom and brush your teeth using a **toothpaste** (Colgate, Pepsodent and Close Up etc)
 - Then you take a bath with **soap** (Dove, Pears, Cinthol etc)
 - Then you suit up! (Zara, Levi’s)
 - You sit on table and proceed for **breakfast** (Kellog’s cornflakes, Saffola Oats, Amul butter etc)

This is when you haven’t even left your house. Got it?
The above activities have been done by mankind for a long time but the point is, there are a lot of companies trying to change the way these things are done. 

**The fact that numerous companies are competing for YOU to use their product is the reason I call this war of money.**

Some will succeed, some will not. 

Companies whose product you like will succeed, the one whose you don’t like will disappear and I’ll be honest here, ain’t no one cares about the one that go extinct. Moreover, the rival companies cheer if their peers go into bankruptcy.

There is no room for mercy, one mistake can wipe any company off the ground no matter how big it is! I’m pretty sure you would have heard the examples of **Nokia, Kodak, Yahoo, BlackBerry** etc.

It is the power of customer that brings the corporate giant to its knees.

Through this blog, I want **YOU** to look around and keep the note of who’s winning this war and who is losing badly.

Use your edge and team up with the winning side, become a part of them and make a fortune off their efforts while you are rewarded just for choosing them. The best thing about this war is, you can switch side whenever you think there’s a turnaround in this war and nobody will hold grudges! 

In further posts I will write about what I mean by joining them and switching sides. Also, I’ll explain where actually this war is being fought.

Until then, goodbye and thank you for reading.
