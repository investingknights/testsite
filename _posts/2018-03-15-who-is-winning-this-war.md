Well, you are surrounded by winners and these winners make all the effort so that they continue to surround you. If they fail to do it, they arenâ€™t winners anymore.

This war has different battle zones **(or sectors)**.

Each battle zone has a different winner, some of them are given below -
 - **Automobile â€“** Maruti Suzuki
 - **Construction â€“** DLF
 - **Telecom â€“** Bharti Airtel
 - **Banking â€“** HDFC
 - **Chemicals â€“** Pidilite Industries
 - **Cigarettes â€“** ITC
 - **Tyres â€“** MRF
 - **Personal Care â€“** Hindustan Unilever Limited

As Iâ€™ve said earlier, you are surrounded by these winners and I can bet you know all of these companies except one or two.

So, itâ€™s evident that these winners grew up amongst us right in front of our eyes!

Still, Iâ€™ll give a little introduction to each of these winners to help a few of my uninformed readers.

 - Every third car you see on the road is manufactured by **Maruti**.
 - Youâ€™ll have at least one friend who lives in a society built by **DLF**.
 - **Bharti Airtel** needs no introduction, their network has the widest coverage area.
 - Who doesnâ€™t have a bank account? You may have heard **HDFC** through their advertisements.
 - Oh, the sweet childhood memories. Remember Fevicol? Leave aside childhood, what to you use when you need to paste something? Single answer, **Fevicol**. Now, itâ€™s your part of the job to pick up the nearest fevicol and look at the manufacturer, thatâ€™s where you are introduced to **Pidilite Industries**.
 - If next time you smoke two street apart from your home, just take a look at the manufacturer on the cigarette box. Most probably itâ€™ll be **ITC**. Some more products from ITC which Iâ€™m damn sure you must have consumed.

 - If youâ€™ve own a two-wheeler or even a four-wheeler and encountered a flat tyre, the mechanic will most probably ask you to use **MRF** tyres.
 - **Hindustan Unilever Limited, HUL** also needs no introduction because we have the habit of using the products and not reading about who makes them. Here is a photo of all the products produced by HUL

Leave alone expiry date, we needed a whole series of advertisement from government to create awareness among the consumers to check at least the **MRP** of the product that we are purchasing. That is some other topic though.

What I mean is look around you.

Whenever you feel bore, start observing your surroundings and figure out what products you use and who makes them, if you start thinking like this then trust me, you wonâ€™t feel bore anymore. Thatâ€™s how I killed my time whenever Iâ€™m stuck somewhere.

That said, **a little observant mind is enough for you to identify the winners**.

The next part is to study them and figure out if they can continue to win.

That Iâ€™ll cover in next post. Until then, goodbye and thank you for reading ðŸ˜Š
